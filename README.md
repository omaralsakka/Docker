# Docker
docker-1 / Hive Helsinki

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Project's goal:**

This project is about the basics of **docker**. The first part is about creating commands for docker containers, networks, services etc.
The second part focuses more on creating images configurations, own servers etc. Finally, I choose for the bonus to learn the docker compising files,
a static website container and debian configured container.

## :warning: **NOTE:**

Check the pdf file for more details about each exercise.
